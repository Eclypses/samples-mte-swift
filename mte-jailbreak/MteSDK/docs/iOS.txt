The following steps will create a new iOS app project in Xcode that uses the
SDK. To add support for the SDK to an existing project, start at step 5.

1. Open Xcode. Choose File->New->Project...
2. Select iOS, then App. Click Next.
3. Fill in the Product Name and other options. Click Next.
4. Select the location to save. Click Create.
5. Select the project (or target) Build Settings tab.
6. In the Build Options section:
   a. Set Enable Bitcode to No if the SDK does not have bitcode.
7. In the Search Paths section:
   a. Set the Header Search Paths to the SDK include directory.
   b. Set the Framework Search Paths to the SDK lib directory.
8. For each target that uses the SDK, select the target Build Phases tab:
   a. Open the Link Binary With Libraries section.
   b. Click +.
   c. Choose Add Other... then Add Files...
   d. Navigate to the SDK lib directory and choose the xcframework.

For Objective-C projects, the SDK header files can be imported like any other.

For Swift projects, the SDK header files must be included from a bridging
header. To create a bridging header for a target that does not already have one:

1. Right click on the target folder and select New File...
2. Choose Header File.
3. Give it a name like Bridging-Header.h.
4. In the target's Build Settings tab, go to the Swift Compiler - General
   section and set the Objective-C Bridging Header option to the header you
   created. Example: <target folder>/Bridging-Header.h
